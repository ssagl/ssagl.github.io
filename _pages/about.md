I am a Ph.D. candidate in economics at [Penn State](https://econ.la.psu.edu). My research interests are in empirical industrial organization. Recently, I have worked on research on the estimation of discrete choice demand models and applications relating to the US automobile market. If you want to, you can view my CV here [<i class="fa-regular fa-file-pdf fa-lg" style="color: #b509ac;"></i>](files/cv.pdf).

<br />
I am on the 2023-24 economics job market. Check back soon for a draft of my job market paper!

[Conformant and Efficient Estimation of Discrete Choice Demand Models](https://ssagl.github.io/papers/like-blp.pdf) (May 2023)  
with Paul Grieco, Charles Murry, and Joris Pinkse  
Revisions requested at _Econometrica_  
* We propose a likelihood-based estimator with exogeneity restrictions
for BLP-type demand models combining microdata, product shares, and prices.  
* Our estimator is implemented in the easy-to-use companion Julia package [Grumps.jl](https://nittanylion.github.io/Grumps.jl/dev/). Install it by typing `using Pkg; Pkg.add("Grumps")` in the Julia REPL.
