I am a Ph.D. candidate in economics at [Penn State](https://econ.la.psu.edu). My research interests are in industrial organization and applied microeconomics. Recently, I have worked on research on the estimation of discrete choice demand models and applications relating to the US automobile market. If you want to, you can view my CV here [<i class="fa-regular fa-file-pdf fa-lg" style="color: #b509ac;"></i>](files/cv.pdf).

I am on the job market for the 2023--24 academic year. Check out the latest version of my job market paper below!

#### Current Research

[<b>Dispersion, Discrimination, and the Price of Your Pickup</b>](https://ssagl.github.io/papers/jmp_sagl.pdf), October 2023. (<b>Job Market Paper</b> [<i class="fa-solid fa-truck-pickup" style="color: #b509ac;"></i>](https://ssagl.github.io/papers/jmp_sagl.pdf))
* Price discrimination is a controversial and pervasive feature of the automobile market. Using repeat purchase data on pickup trucks, fully controlling for product heterogeneity, I establish that individual consumers persistently pay high or low prices across vehicle purchases. On average, women and Hispanics pay higher prices for the same pickup, but this explains less than 0.5% of price dispersion. These results suggest that persistent consumer preferences beyond coarse demographics are known by dealers and used for pricing. Using a structural model, I study the role of information about consumers available to firms in the welfare effects of price discrimination. To do so, I overcome a missing data problem common to settings with transaction data: consumer-specific prices of non-chosen alternatives are unobservable. I solve this problem by developing and estimating a novel discrete choice model of supply and demand that recovers unobserved consumer-specific prices and consumer-specific price sensitivity. Compared to uniform pricing, price discrimination increases profits and total welfare but, on average, harms consumers. Women and Hispanics lose most from price discrimination. However, price discrimination only on broad demographic groups, including gender, race, and income, is not profitable relative to uniform pricing. This suggests that information beyond demographic groups drives the profitability of price discrimination.

[<b>Conformant and Efficient Estimation of Discrete Choice Demand Models</b>](https://ssagl.github.io/papers/like-blp.pdf), May 2023.  
with Paul Grieco, Charles Murry, and Joris Pinkse  
<b>Revisions requested at _Econometrica_</b> 
* We propose a likelihood-based estimator with exogeneity restrictions
for BLP-type demand models combining microdata, product shares, and prices.  
* Our estimator is implemented in the easy-to-use companion Julia package [Grumps.jl](https://nittanylion.github.io/Grumps.jl/dev/). Install it by typing `using Pkg; Pkg.add("Grumps")` in the Julia REPL.
